        <!-- Originally I had two initial features I wanted to add. Firstly, it was the previously stated button and how I initally wanted to a clip in the bottom corners of the page to indicate the button to the next or previous pages. Another feature was descriptions of each of the artworks. However, it was unnecessary and instead I opted to make it just a gallery of all my favorite art. Lastly, I opted to have four artworks instead of three as I actually had real estate to do so (I didnt realise I had another page). -->
